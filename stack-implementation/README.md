# Stack Implementation in TypeScript

## Description

This project implements a stack data structure using TypeScript. The stack supports basic operations such as pushing, popping, and peeking at the top item. A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last item added is the first one to be removed.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the item from the top of the stack.
- **Peek**: Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

## Installation

To use this stack implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stack-implementation.git
    cd stack-implementation

2. Install Dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install

3. Build the Project
    ```bash
    npm run build

## Usage

To use the stack, import the Stack class and create an instance

## Methods

1. push(item: T): void

Adds an item to the top of the stack.

2. pop(): T | undefined

Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack. Returns undefined if the stack is empty.

3. peek(): T | undefined

Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it. Returns undefined if the stack is empty.

4. isEmpty(): boolean

Checks if the stack is empty. Returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise returns false.
